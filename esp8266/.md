The onboard 5V DC-DC step-down converter on the NodeMCU ESP8266 V3 Lua simplifies power management when interfacing with other components, as it can power external devices like servos and the PWM driver while the NodeMCU itself is powered via USB.

### Wiring Diagram with NodeMCU's Onboard 5V Converter

Given that the NodeMCU has an onboard 5V DC-DC step-down converter, you can use this feature to power the Arduino and other components. Here's how to wire everything up:

#### 1. NodeMCU to Arduino Serial Communication

1. **NodeMCU TX (Transmit)** -> **Arduino RX (Receive)**
   - Directly connect TX from the NodeMCU to RX on the Arduino. The Arduino’s RX pin can handle the 3.3V signal from the NodeMCU.

2. **NodeMCU RX (Receive)** -> **Arduino TX (Transmit)**
   - Use a voltage divider to step down the 5V TX signal from the Arduino to 3.3V for the NodeMCU. Connect:
     - **Arduino TX** -> **1kΩ resistor** -> **NodeMCU RX**
     - **NodeMCU RX** -> **2kΩ resistor** -> **GND**

3. **NodeMCU GND (Ground)** -> **Arduino GND (Ground)**
   - Connect the grounds together to ensure a common reference.

4. **NodeMCU VCC (Power)** -> **Arduino 5V (Power)**
   - Since the NodeMCU has a 5V step-down converter, it can provide 5V power. Connect the VCC of NodeMCU to the Arduino's 5V pin to power it. Make sure the Arduino can handle the 5V supply.

#### 2. Adafruit PWM Servo Driver to Arduino

1. **PWM Driver VCC** -> **NodeMCU 5V (Power)**
   - Connect the VCC of the PWM driver to the 5V pin on the NodeMCU, which comes from the onboard DC-DC converter.

2. **PWM Driver GND** -> **NodeMCU GND (Ground)**
   - Connect the GND of the PWM driver to the GND of the NodeMCU.

3. **PWM Driver SDA** -> **Arduino A4 (SDA)**
   - Connect the SDA pin of the PWM driver to the A4 pin on the Arduino (SDA).

4. **PWM Driver SCL** -> **Arduino A5 (SCL)**
   - Connect the SCL pin of the PWM driver to the A5 pin on the Arduino (SCL).

#### 3. Adafruit PWM Servo Driver to Servos

1. **PWM Driver Channels (0-5)** -> **Servo Control Wires**
   - Connect each channel of the PWM driver to the corresponding control wire of each servo.

2. **PWM Driver GND** -> **Servo GND (Ground)**
   - Connect the ground of the PWM driver to the ground of the servos.

3. **PWM Driver VCC** -> **Servo VCC (Power)**
   - Connect the VCC of the PWM driver to the power line of the servos. Ensure the power supply can handle the current requirements of the servos.

### Key Points

- **NodeMCU's 5V DC-DC Converter**: Use this for powering the Arduino and other components. Make sure to verify that the power is stable and adequate for your needs.
- **Voltage Divider for RX**: Use a voltage divider for the Arduino TX to NodeMCU RX connection to protect the NodeMCU from 5V logic.

This setup should allow the NodeMCU to control the Arduino and PWM driver effectively, providing servo control capabilities via the web server hosted on the NodeMCU.
